# Virtual Memory Management Library

This directory contains the implementation of a virtual memory management library that simulates paging and address translation.

## Contents

- **VirtualMemory.h/cpp**: Core implementation of the virtual memory system.
- **PhysicalMemory.h/cpp**: Interface for interacting with simulated physical memory.
- **MemoryConstants.h**: Defines constants for memory layout and addressing.
- **Makefile**: Build script for compiling the library.

## Features

- **Address Translation**: Converts virtual addresses to physical addresses using a hierarchical page table.
- **Page Fault Handling**: Handles page faults with eviction and restoration mechanisms.
- **Eviction Policy**: Implements a cyclic distance algorithm for efficient memory management.
- **Memory Initialization**: Supports clearing and restoring memory frames.

## Building

Run `make` to build the library, which generates `libVirtualMemory.a` for use in other projects.
